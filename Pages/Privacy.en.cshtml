 <h3 class="mt-4 h-notes">Project goal</h3>
 <p>
 To create a tool for searching identical or similar melodies.
 </p>


 <h3 class="mt-4 h-notes">Practical use</h3>
 <p>
 <b>Plagiarism detection</b> — composers produce thousands of new melodies daily. As a result, the risk of accidentally repeating an existing melody increases, while copyright legislation becomes stricter. A melody database, when populated, will allow authors to check their melody for potential matches before publication and thus avoid legal issues.
 </p>
 <p>
 <b>Research</b> — musicologists need accurate tools for comparative analysis of works from different eras, styles, genres, etc. Melody comparison tools will enable, for example, assessing the influence of folk art on a particular composer or the degree of stylistic affinity among a group of authors.

 Technical notes:
 </h3>
 <p>
 Currently, uploading MIDI files is allowed only for monophonic musical material. Polyphonic material, or MIDI files in which Note-On events occur before Note-Off events of the previous note, lead to incorrect model behavior.
 It is recommended to use MIDI format1; MIDI0 is not always fully supported regarding key signatures.
 Multitrack MIDI files are handled correctly if each track is monophonic. In that case, tracks will be processed sequentially, but their use is not recommended.
 Work on handling these limitations is planned. For now, to make a MIDI file comply with the stated requirement, use external software (MIDI or notation editors).
